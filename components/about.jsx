            Hi, I’m Richard Kortey, a passionate web developer based in Ghana .
            I specialize in creating dynamic and responsive web applications
            that deliver exceptional user experiences. With a strong foundation
            in front-end technologies like React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,
            along with experience in back-end frameworks and databases like
            Node.js and MySQL, I bring full-stack development skills to the
            table. Driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, I’m
            constantly learning and refining my skills to stay up-to-date with
            the latest industry trends and best practices. Whether it's building
            interactive user interfaces or designing scalable backend systems, I
            enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful solutions.
            When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
            contributing to open-source projects, or sharing my knowledge with
            the developer community. Let’s connect and create something amazing
            together!
